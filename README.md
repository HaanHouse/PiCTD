# PiCTD
Using a Raspberry Pi Zero W to record conductivity, tempurature and depth (CTD)
with python 2.7 Idea inspired by Dr. Andrew Thaler
[OpenCTD](https://github.com/OceanographyforEveryone/OpenCTD)and 
[Oceanography for Everyone](http://us11.campaign-archive1.com/home/?u=bbe1875ee67aa199087ef6805&id=9127339d31)
lots of good info there. 

I'll get this setup better soon. 

Til then I'll upload my
python 2.7 files and my .txt .csv files from tests. file naming is 'CTD'+YY+MM+DD+HH+MM+'.txt'
